Feature: LaserStartupConfig
	In order to have simulated tenants that are realistic
	As an admin
	I want to be able to run our default recipe

@mytag
#Scenario: Load modules and recipes
#	# create site
#	Given I have installed Orchard
#	
#	# I have to install our modules
#	Given I have all Laser modules
#		And I have all Laser themes
#	# and I should also enable Laser.Orchard.StartupConfig
#	# Given I have module "Laser.Orchard.StartupConfig" with its recipes
#
#	# check that the recipe has been loaded and is available
#	#When I go to "admin"
#	#	And I go to "Admin/Modules"
#		When I try to go to "Admin/Modules/Recipes"
#	Then I should see "Run this recipe to set things up and enable the standard Laser modules."

#Scenario: Launch our recipe
#	# create site

#	# I have to install our modules
#	Given I have all Laser modules
#		And I have all Laser themes
